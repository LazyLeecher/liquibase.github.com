I"~)<p>Liquibase 3.6.0 (actually 3.6.1 as well) is now available from <a href="http://liquibase.org/download">liquibase.org/download</a> and through the Maven repositories. Question or comments can be directed <a href="http://liquibase.org/community">to liquibase.org/community</a></p>

<p>Version 3.6.0 is primarily a bugfix release, but there have been over new 1000 commits since the 3.5.x series, so TONS of good new things.</p>

<h3 id="highlights-include">Highlights include</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Improved database support for MS SqlServer, Oracle, Sybase, DB2 on Z/OS and others</li>
  <li>Improvements to spring and includeAll handling</li>
  <li>UTF-8/Non-ASCII fixes</li>
  <li>And much more</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="checksum-logic-change">Checksum logic change</h3>

<p>The 3.6.0 release should be a drop-in replacement for anyone using Liquibase, but some of the bugfixes required an update to the checksum logic.</p>

<p>This means that when you first run an update command, Liquibase will transparently replace the old version with the new version BUT it will not be able to detect whether they actually changed or not, so any “runOnChange” triggers will NOT execute on the first run of the upgrade.</p>

<h3 id="looking-forward-api-changes">Looking Forward: API Changes</h3>

<p>The main goal of 3.6.0 was to collect all the outstanding bugfixes and minor features into a base release to build on for future changes.</p>

<p>Part of the reason for the gap between 3.5 and 3.6 is that I have been busily working on an extensive code cleanup/re-organization task in Liquibase concurrently and it has proved too difficult to keep the two branches in sync.
I had been making the changes in a separate branch because I’ve always tried to keep API-compatibility between releases to avoid breaking extensions, and the clean-up work is the point where I’m needing to break some of those APIs in order to support future functionality.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it has gotten too difficult to manage both branches in parallel and the progress in both has suffered, so I am going to take a new approach: starting with the 3.7.0 release, I am going to be making API-breaking changes from release to release until they finished, at which point we will release 4.0.0 and resume the normal no-API-breaking-changes rule.
This change only affects users of Liquibase extensions–<em>changelogs will ALWAYS backwards compatible.</em></p>

<p>With each 3.x release, I will document any code migration changes needed as part of the release notes, but for those who prefer to wait for the final 4.0 stable release to update your extensions I will continue to provide bugfixes for 3.6.x even as newer versions come out.</p>

<p>As an example of changes I’m planning on making, I have already started pulling out the custom ServiceLocator logic that causes so much pain with the standard java.util.ServiceLoader classes.</p>

<p>To simplify issue management, I’m going to migrate our issue tracking from Jira to Github. I’ll post an announcement as that is finished.</p>

<p>I am finishing up re-introduction of a public build server and snapshot builds. I’ll post an announcement as that is finished.</p>

<h3 id="reminder-community-survey-ends-saturday-april-14th">REMINDER: Community Survey Ends Saturday April 14th.</h3>

<p>It should only take a few minutes to fill out and is a huge help in understanding how Liquibase is used and how we can improve.</p>
