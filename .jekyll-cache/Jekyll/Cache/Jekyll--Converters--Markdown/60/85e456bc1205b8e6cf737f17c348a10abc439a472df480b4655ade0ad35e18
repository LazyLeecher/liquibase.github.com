I"Ö<p>Listening to feedback from the community is a vital part of any open source project and it has frankly been a little too long since Iâ€™ve had the chance to hear the voice of those who make use of Liquibase. 
As I make more time to devote to the project, Iâ€™m keen to understand your perspective â€“ if nothing else, to inform my priorities as I go through pull requests and think through additional updates.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, Iâ€™d like to announce the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/Atzmtw7XZatOehuP2">2018 Liquibase Community Survey!</a> 
Please take 5 minutes to fill out the survey and give me your thoughts on the project, how you use it, and how we can continue to improve it.</p>

<p>Lastly, a slightly shameless plug. In addition to founding and serving as the primary maintainer of Liquibase, my day is spent working on enterprise-grade features at Datical. 
The last question of the Liquibase Community Survey is a question on whether I can follow up to learn more from you. 
As a part of this follow-on, the team at Datical would love to connect with those of you willing to spare a half hour so they can better understand how to provide continued corporate support for this open source project while continuing to build out a commercial roadmap. 
So, as you are taking the community survey, I encourage you to be open to the follow-up as it only helps me and the team at Datical figure out how to best balance the needs of the open source community and the commercial market.</p>

<p>Thanks for your input! Iâ€™m looking forward to hearing what each of you has to say.</p>
