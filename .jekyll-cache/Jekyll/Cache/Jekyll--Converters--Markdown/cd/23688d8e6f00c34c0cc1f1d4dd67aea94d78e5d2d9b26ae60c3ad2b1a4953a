I"Ô<p>Once youâ€™ve created a <a href="/documentation/databasechangelog.html">database changelog file</a>, what is the best way to run it? As always, it depends on what works best for you. There are three main ways to run Liquibase: â€œautomatically on startupâ€, â€œmanually as neededâ€, or â€œJust give me the SQL and Iâ€™ll do it myselfâ€. All three work with any changelog file, so use the method (or combination of methods) which works best for your project.</p>
