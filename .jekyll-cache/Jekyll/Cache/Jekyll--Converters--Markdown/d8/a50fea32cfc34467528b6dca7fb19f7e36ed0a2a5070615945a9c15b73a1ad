I"Ã<p>There are times when I have seen projects with a version 1.9 that means â€œthe last 1.x release before 2.0â€. In our case, â€œ1.9â€ simply means â€œthe release after 1.8â€</p>

<p>After a bit of discussion on the liquibase-user mailing list, we decided that we didnâ€™t want to go to a 2.0 release at this point because there has not been any major changes and we have kept backwords compatibility.</p>

<p>Therefore, we are going to continue our current 1.x numbering strategy and continue to provide evolutionary improvements for the foreseeable future. 1.10, 1.11 etc. do look a bit confusing and like 1.1.0, 1.1.1 etc, but I think most Liquibase users will be smart enough to figure it out :)</p>
