I"≈<p>If you missed last month, I‚Äôve started a monthly status post to give a better window into Liquibase development and the Liquibase community. I‚Äôd appreciate any feedback you have on how helpful (or not) it is and/or any suggestions you have.</p>

<p>New this month is the Liquibase 2015 Survey. Since I don‚Äôt have direct contact with the majority of Liquibase users, it is my best opportunity to understand how Liquibase is actually used in the wild to help prioritize features.
If you‚Äôve not filled out the survey yet, you can find it at <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/TNXBl5GsPv">http://goo.gl/forms/TNXBl5GsPv</a>. The survey ends September 18th, 2015.</p>

<p>No new releases in the last month, but I‚Äôm planning on a 3.4.2 bugfix release in September.</p>

<p>Some interesting statistics from the liquibase.org traffic</p>

<ul>
  <li>We get nearly 14,000 sessions per week</li>
  <li>Bing and DuckDuckGo are neck and neck for referrals, but Google still accounts for 98.6% of search engine traffic</li>
  <li>Nearly 15% of people are visiting from a Linux machine and more people use Android than iOS</li>
  <li>Over 68% use Chrome while less than 4% use IE</li>
</ul>

<p>This month‚Äôs ‚Äúcontributor of the month‚Äù is <a href="https://github.com/mattbertolini">Matt Bertolini</a>. He saw that the Ant integration was getting fairly out of date and took it upon himself to refactor it.
Not only was the <a href="https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/275">pull request one of the best I‚Äôve seen</a> but he watched for related Jira issues and forum questions after his code was released and addressed any questions and problems that came up.
While I always appreciate pull requests, the on-going maintenance of new features and helping other users with related problems is at <em>least</em> as valuable. As contributor of the month, Matt gets a 13,000 mAh USB battery graciously donated by <a href="http://datical.com">datical.com</a> in addition to my thanks.</p>
