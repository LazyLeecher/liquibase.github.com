I"å<p>There was a great post the other day on Coding Horror titled â€œ<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001050.html">Get Your Database Under Version Control</a>â€.  It references a good <a href="http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/archive/2008/01/30/11702.aspx">series of posts by K. Scott Allen</a> on  database version control, but also makes the point that <em>â€œWhen it comes to version control, the database is often a second or even third-class citizen.â€</em></p>
