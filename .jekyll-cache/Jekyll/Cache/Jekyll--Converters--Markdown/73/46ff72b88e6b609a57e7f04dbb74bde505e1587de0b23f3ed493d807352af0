I"’<p>Looking for an easier way to use Liquibase?</p>

<p>I recently launched a â€œLiquibase IDEâ€ Kickstarter project called â€œLiquibenchâ€ at <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/149257506/liquibench" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/149257506/liquibench</a> with the goal of making Liquibase more Intellij/Eclipse/Resharper and less XML-editor+command-prompt.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve started similar projects over the years, but to finish and support them took far more time than I was able to provide. My hope with this project is to jump-start it as a commercial offering in order to provide the effort required to build it and the ability to support it long term.</p>

<p>If you are interested in such a tool, please consider helping to fund the project. A successful kickstarter project will ensure it gets built, prove the market, and greatly expand the team dedicated to Liquibase.</p>
