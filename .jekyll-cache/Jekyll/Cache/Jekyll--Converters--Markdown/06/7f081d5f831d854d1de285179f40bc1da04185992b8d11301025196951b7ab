<p>This is the first in a planned monthly post designed to give a better window into Liquibase development and the Liquibase community. I’d appreciate any feedback you have on how helpful (or not) it is and/or any suggestions you have.</p>

<p>My work on Liquibase was split last month between a 3.4.1 release and continuing work on Liquibase 4.0. The full scope (and timeline) of 4.0 is still being determined, but the high-level goals are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simplify and standardize the codebase</li>
  <li>Improve the testability</li>
  <li>Make larger internal API changes to support new functionality</li>
</ul>

<p>So far, the 4.0 work has focused on simplifying the Statement/Change/Generator/Snapshot logic and improving the testing of the interaction between Liquibase and the database. For more information and to help review the code so far, see <a href="http://forum.liquibase.org/#Topic/49382000001343003">http://forum.liquibase.org/#Topic/49382000001343003</a></p>

<p>The goal of 4.0 is to have no end-user breaking changes, but there will be API changes that will affect extension writers. Documentation on the upgrade process will be part of the release.</p>

<p>Beyond codebase changes, I switched the blog hosting from a separate server to being a part of the <a href="https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase.github.com">liquibase.org github pages sites</a>. Anyone using an RSS reader should have been redirected, and for everyone else the main difference should be posts now showing in the left navigation of liquibase.org and a more consistent design. For me, I now have one less server to maintain which is always good.</p>

<p>I also recently became the proud owner of the <a href="https://twitter.com/liquibase">@liquibase</a>, twitter account so feel free to follow and/or contact me there.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to use each monthly update as an opportunity to recognize a different contributor. As an open source project, Liquibase is a group effort with usually very little recognition.</p>

<p>This month I’d like to thank <a href="https://github.com/mches">Mark Chesney</a>.  Over the last few months he has sent nearly <a href="https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr+author%3Amches+">50 pull requests</a> and has not only done a good job of managing the corresponding <a href="https://liquibase.jira.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=mches">liquibase.jira.com issues</a>, but has also helped answer questions, find work-arounds, and triage issues on other issues as well. Most of his work has centered around improving MS SqlServer support, and I appreciate all he has done.</p>
