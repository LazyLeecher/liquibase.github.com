<h3 id="what-license-is-liquibase-released-under">What license is Liquibase released under?</h3>

<p>Liquibase is released under the Apache License, version 2.0.</p>

<h3 id="where-can-i-get-the-source-code">Where can I get the source code?</h3>
<p>The source is available from the main <a href="download/index.html">download</a> page</p>

<h3 id="how-does-liquibase-compare-to-tools-that-compare-development-database-with-production-databases-to-generate-change-lists">How does Liquibase compare to tools that compare development database with production databases to generate change lists?</h3>
<p>Liquibase works better because it <strong>understands</strong> what the changes are. For example, a database comparison program would simply see the â€œpersonâ€ table on integration has a â€œfirstnameâ€ and a â€œlastnameâ€ column, but on live, the â€œpersonâ€ table has a â€œnameâ€ column. It would report that you need to drop the â€œnameâ€ column and add a â€œfirstnameâ€ and a â€œlastnameâ€ column. While this would leave you with the correct schema, you would lose everyoneâ€™s name in the process. With Liquibase, you would have a changeset that says â€œrename â€˜nameâ€™ to â€˜lastnameâ€™ and add a â€˜firstnameâ€™ columnâ€ or, even better, â€œsplit the name column on a space and place the values in new â€˜firstnameâ€™ and â€˜lastnameâ€™ columns, then drop the â€˜nameâ€™ column.â€ Knowing <strong>why</strong> they are different allows changes to production databases without the fear of losing valuable data.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-multiple-processesapplication-servers-attempt-to-migrate-the-database-at-the-same-time">What if multiple processes/application servers attempt to migrate the database at the same time?</h3>
<p>Liquibase uses a distributed locking system to only allow one process to update the database at a time. The other processes will simply wait until the lock has been released.</p>

<h3 id="does-liquibase-work-with-branches">Does Liquibase work with branches?</h3>
<p>Yes. Since each change is independent, database changes that had been made in a different branch, then merged in will be run the next time Liquibase is run. You may run into a problem with the order that the statements are ran, but any issues you have can be easily solved by re-ordering the changelog files.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-have-to-specify-an-author-tag">Why do I have to specify an â€œauthorâ€ tag?</h3>
<p>Why not just an â€œidâ€ tag? The main reason for both the author the id attribute tag is because it is too easy for more than one person to a tag with the same â€œidâ€ valueâ€“especially when using multiple branches. The source control system is going to resolve and merge two change sets added on different branches, but it wonâ€™t care that there are two different changesets with the same â€œidâ€, and once a change set has been run against a database with one id, you canâ€™t (easily) change it. By also determining change set uniqueness based on an author tag, the chance of duplicates is lowered.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-i-really-dont-want-to-specify-an-author-tag">What if I really donâ€™t want to specify an author tag?</h3>
<p>There are times an organization would not want to have changes tied back to a particular individual or if the original author isnâ€™t actually known. If this is the case, simply make up a value such as â€œUNKNOWNâ€.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-specify-vendor-specific-features-such-as-engineinnodb-in-mysql">How can I specify vendor specific features such as ENGINE=InnoDB in MySQL?</h3>
<p>We do not currently have a way to specify vendor specific extensions to the create table tag, and so you would need to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;sql&gt;</code> tag and specify your create table statement manually. Of course you would be able to configure your mysql install to use innodb as the
default storage engine with default-storage-engine=INNODB.</p>

<p>Since 1.9, the <a href="documentation/modify_sql.html">modifySql</a> tag can be used to modify the generated SQL.</p>
