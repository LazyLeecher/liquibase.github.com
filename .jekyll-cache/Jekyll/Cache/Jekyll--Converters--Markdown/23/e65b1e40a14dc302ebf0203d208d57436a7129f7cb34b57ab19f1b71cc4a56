I"i<p>If you visit <a href="http://liquibase.org/forum">http://liquibase.org/forum</a> you will notice that it looks completely different.  We were getting hit pretty hard with spam over the last few months on the old forum and I concluded that we could not stop it with the current simple machines software.  As a result, we have moved to a Zoho-based forum.</p>
