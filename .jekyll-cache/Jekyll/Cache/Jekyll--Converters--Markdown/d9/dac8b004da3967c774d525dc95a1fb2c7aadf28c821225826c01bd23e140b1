I"¡<p>Listening to feedback from the community is a vital part of any open source project and it has frankly been a little too long since Iâ€™ve had the chance to hear the voice of those who make use of Liquibase. 
As I make more time to devote to the project, Iâ€™m keen to understand your perspective â€“ if nothing else, to inform my priorities as I go through pull requests and think through additional updates.</p>
