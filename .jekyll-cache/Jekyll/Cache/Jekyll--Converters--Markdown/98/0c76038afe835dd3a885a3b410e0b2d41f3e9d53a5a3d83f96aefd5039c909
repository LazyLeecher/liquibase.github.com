I"Ô<p>Last year, we invited the Liquibase community to take a survey to help us understand how Liquibase is used and how we can improve. 
A small sample size from our community (a little over 200 people out of 4M+ downloads in the past 12 months) participated via the Liquibase.org website. Hereâ€™s what we learned.</p>

<h3 id="summing-it-up">Summing it up</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Liquibase is used by companies of all sizes.</li>
  <li>Most Liquibase users find the tool useful and use extensions to meet their needs.</li>
  <li>Although most users find the documentation helpful, weâ€™d love to see that number higher than 68%. Weâ€™ll look at improving the documentation and providing links in more helpful places in the near future.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also took the time to interview a handful of users to ask more in-depth questions to see what features theyâ€™re looking for. More on that soon.</p>

<p>Thanks to all that participated in the survey and interviews! We look forward to making improvements and getting more feedback from the community.</p>
