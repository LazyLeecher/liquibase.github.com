I"¥<p>Liquibase has always focused mainly on ‚Äústandard‚Äù SQL databases, but we are looking to improving support for NoSQL databases like Cassandra, MongoDB, Hadoop and others.
We‚Äôd also like to make sure our support for databases like DB2 on iSeries and System z as well as Redshift, Azure SQL Server, Vertica, Greenplumb etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with what is really needed to manage data and schemas on any of these databases and/or the particular pain points that need to be solved for each.</p>

<p>If <strong>YOU</strong> have experience with any of these databases, we‚Äôd love to do a quick phone questionnaire about what you currently use, your ideal workflow, and a bit about your team and application size.
Just send me an email at <a href="nathan@liquibase.org">nathan@liquibase.org</a> and let me know where you are located so we can coordinate a convenient time for everyone.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
