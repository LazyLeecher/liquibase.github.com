I"><p>As many of you know, a few years after starting the Liquibase open-source project, I joined the team at Datical. 
For those who are unaware, Datical is a commercial solution built on top of Liquibase. 
Datical is also the primary maintainer of the Liquibase open source project - though we are always looking for more engaged community members who might be interested in being stewards to the project along with me. 
While I’ve enjoyed the years of growth - both Liquibase and Datical have seen, I had always hoped for a better transition from the open-source project I founded to the commercial software that I now help architect. 
Finally, the wait is over – and I’m tremendously excited to announce that Datical’s latest release supports users bringing in their own XML changesets and changelogs from Liquibase.</p>
