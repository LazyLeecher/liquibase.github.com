I"<p>Liquibase 2.0 Beta 3 has been released. <em>Note: This is not yet production ready code and contains known issues</em></p>

<p>The goal of the beta3 release is to provide a new stable release for entries in the <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/extensions">plugin contest</a> to build off of and for others who want to beta test the 2.0 release.</p>

<p>Major changes in the beta3 release include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Converting to Maven for our build process</li>
  <li>Major changes to the database snapshot functionality including better flexibility and performance</li>
  <li>Lots of bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>Beta 3 should be the last “re-architecting” release. From now until the 2.0 final release we are going to focus on new features and bug fixes. The goal for 2.0 final is mid-September.</p>

<p>As always, let <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/forum">us know</a> if you have any questions or problems.</p>

<p>You can download the newest release from the <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/download">Liquibase download page</a></p>
