I"¼<p>2.0 RC4 is now available.  Like always, you can download it from <a href="http://liquibase.org/download">http://liquibase.org/download</a>.</p>

<p>The main changes in RC4 are improvements to the Maven POM configuration, and a change to how Liquibase classes and extensions are found and loaded.</p>
