I"0<p>A quick demo of the Liquibase Database Refactoring IDE is now available on the Liquibase site.</p>

<p>It shows how to connect to your database, apply several refactorings to your database, then update an independent database with the new changesâ€“all from the comfort of an IDE environment.</p>

<p>The IDE is available as either a stand-alone tool or as an Eclipse plug-in.</p>
