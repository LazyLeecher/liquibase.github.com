I"<p>One problem with running an open source project is that we donâ€™t really have â€œcustomersâ€ to contact for feedback and product suggestions. I can always just add features that <strong>I</strong> think make sense, but one thing Iâ€™ve learned is that people use Liquibase in amazing ways I would never have imagined.</p>

<p>That is where the <strong><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/TNXBl5GsPv">Liquibase survey</a></strong> comes in: it is your chance to provide feedback on how you use Liquibase and what is important to you so that I can better prioritize efforts over the next year.</p>

<h2 id="your-participation-and-time-is-greatly-appreciated">Your participation and time is greatly appreciated</h2>

<h3 id="-liquibase-survey-2015-form-">â€”â€“&gt; <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/TNXBl5GsPv">Liquibase Survey 2015 Form</a> &lt;â€”â€“</h3>

<p>If you know others that use Liquibase, please forward them the survey as well. Even better, if you know someone who is NOT using Liquibase, send them the survey as well.</p>

<p>The more information I can gather the better picture I will have.</p>

<p><strong>Survey runs until September 18th, 2015</strong></p>
