I"0<p>I posted the slides from my Percona Live talk at <a href="https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/sessions/liquibase-source-control-your-schema">https://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/sessions/liquibase-source-control-your-schema</a>.</p>

<p>I modified them from the actual talk slides to also include my speaking notes so they will be more helpful for those who were not able to make it to the talk or if you wish you took better notes.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m hoping to post a recorded version of the talk in the next few weeks as well.</p>
