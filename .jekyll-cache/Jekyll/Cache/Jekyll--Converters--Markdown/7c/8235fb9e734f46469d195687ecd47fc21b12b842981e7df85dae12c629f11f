I"‘<p>When I first released Liquibase as open source in 2006, Sourceforge was the obvious place to host the project. Over the years, however, Iâ€™ve been slowing shifting functionality off sourceforge to <a href="https://liquibase.jira.com" title="liquibase.jira.com">liquibase.jira.com</a>, <a href="https://github.com/liquibase" title="github.com/liquibase">github.com/liquibase</a> and this blog.</p>
