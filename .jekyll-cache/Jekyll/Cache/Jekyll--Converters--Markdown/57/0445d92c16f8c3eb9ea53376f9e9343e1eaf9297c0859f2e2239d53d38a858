<p>Liquibase uses a branching strategy using the following long-lived branches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>master: Corresponds to the next non-patch release in progress</li>
  <li>â€#.#.xâ€. Each non-patch release such as â€œ3.1â€ gets a branch for itself and its patch releases. For example, the 3.1.0 release will be the start of the â€œ3.1.xâ€ branch</li>
</ul>

<p>Individual features and bug fixes should be developed in their own short-lived feature branches with a pull request to incorporate them into the main repository branches.
For more information on pull requests and GitHub usage, see <a href="contribute.html">contributing to Liquibase</a>.</p>

<p>As part of each release, the releasing branch will be tagged with the actual version number and the changes will be merged into all downstream branches.</p>

<h3 id="which-branch-do-i-use">Which branch do I use?</h3>

<p>When working on a bug or feature, the code should based off the branch corresponding to the furthest back version family that will include the change.</p>

<p>So if you are ok with the change only going into the next release, branch off â€œmasterâ€. If you are using version 3.0.2 and need the change in an upcoming 3.0 patch release, branch off â€œ3.1.xâ€.</p>

<p>If you have questions, <a href="../community/index.html">help is available</a>.</p>

<h3 id="example-workflow">Example Workflow</h3>

<p>Starting state: there are 3 active branches: â€œmasterâ€, â€œ3.0.xâ€, and â€œ3.1.xâ€. 3.0.3 and 3.1.2 are the most recent releases in the previous release families.</p>

<p>Because 3.1 has been released, most development is occurring off the â€œmasterâ€ branch. Features are developed in fork branches off â€œmasterâ€ and when they are done, pull requests are created and accepted into master.</p>

<p>If a bug is found that needs to be fixed in a 3.1, it is worked on in a branch off 3.1 and when it is done a pull request is created and accepted into the 3.1.x branch.</p>

<p>When we are ready to have a 3.1.3 release, the 3.1.x branch is tagged as â€œ3.1.3â€ and then merged into â€œmasterâ€.</p>

<p>When we are ready to release the code in â€œmasterâ€ and a version number is decided on such as 3.2, a â€œ3.2.xâ€ branch is created for final testing and tagged as â€œ3.2.0â€ at release time.</p>
