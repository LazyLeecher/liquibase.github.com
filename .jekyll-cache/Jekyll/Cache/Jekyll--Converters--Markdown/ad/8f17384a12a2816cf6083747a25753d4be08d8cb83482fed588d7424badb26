I"#<p>As of the 2.0 release of Liquibase, we will switch to being licensed under the Apache License, version 2.0 rather than the LGPL.</p>

<p>The reason for the change is to make Liquibase more business friendly, especially with regards to being able to write <a href="http://liquibase.org/extensions">extensions</a> without worrying about license requirements that may be imposed by the LGPL. Iâ€™ll work on updating the license information on the web site and in the 2.0 codebase over the next few days. Let me know if you have any questions.</p>
