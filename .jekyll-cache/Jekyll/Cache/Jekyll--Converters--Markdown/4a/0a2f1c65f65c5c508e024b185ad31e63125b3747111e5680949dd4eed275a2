I"É<p>Now that 3.0.0 is out, Iâ€™ve cleaned up the Jira process a bit, created more git branches and tried to document it on the liquibase.org site.</p>

<p>On the liquibase.org top navigation bar, there is now a â€œDevâ€ link that brings to you to information on working with the Liquibase code, GitHub and Jira.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/development/branches.html">branches</a> page  describes the the new branching strategy where we have a â€œnextâ€ branch for the next major release and a â€œ#.#.xâ€ branch for each release family for patch releases. You can see it in action now with both 3.0.0 and 3.0.1 in the â€œ3.0.xâ€ branch and already some changes in the â€œnextâ€ branch for 3.1.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/development/jira.html">Using Jira</a> page describes how we use the various Jira fields. I simplified the Jira process a bit, taking out the â€œresolvedâ€ stage in favor of just â€œclosedâ€, removed fields we were not using, and created additional components for better categorization.</p>

<p>There is other good information in the new developer section of the site including how to build Liquibase with Maven and I will continue to add more down the road.</p>
