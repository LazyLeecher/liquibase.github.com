I"ä<p>Since the 3.0 beta 2 release, I have been focused on the new liquibase.org website, bug fixes, performance improvements, API cleanup and additional automated test creation and fixup.</p>

<h3 id="work-remaining-in-the-final-push-to-300">Work remaining in the final push to 3.0.0:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Finish documentation of new 3.0 features (including a ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs new in 3.0‚Äù list)</li>
  <li>Finish Java API cleanup/documentation</li>
  <li>Clean up ‚Äúfix in 3.0.0‚Äù Jira list that includes many issues that have already been fixed and others that will not make it for 3.0.</li>
  <li>Any remaining showstopper bugs found in RC1</li>
</ul>

<p>My hope is to have 3.0.0 released in the first week of June.</p>

<p>The 3.0 RC1 release is the first 3.0 release that is available through the maven repository as well. It should be working it‚Äôs way through the mirroring process now.</p>
