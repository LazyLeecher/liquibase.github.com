I"o<p>For those of you who don’t know, I’ve been working for <a title="Datical" href="http://datical.com">Datical</a> for the last year and a half as “Benevolent Dictator for Life.” I often joke that I feel like I’m retired because after years of working on Liquibase as a hobby on nights and weekends I’m now spending my days working on my “hobby”.</p>
