I"Ð<p>Thanks to the generous people at Atlassian, we now have a much nicer issue tracker and source browser than before.  You can check out our Jira instance at <a href="http://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE">http://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE</a> and our svn repository at <a href="http://liquibase.jira.com/source/browse/CORE">http://liquibase.jira.com/source/browse/CORE</a>.</p>

<p>The issues were bulk moved from the sourceforge tracker, so I will be going over them to recategorize and prioritize them over the next week.</p>

<p>We also now have a message board at <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/forum">http://www.liquibase.org/forum</a> in place of the old liquibase-user, liquibase-devel, and liquibase-doc mailing lists.  A copy of all top-level (non-reply) posts are being forwarded to the mailing lists to help with the transition, but please use the forum from now on.</p>

<p>If you have any comments or suggestions on the new setup, please let me know.</p>
