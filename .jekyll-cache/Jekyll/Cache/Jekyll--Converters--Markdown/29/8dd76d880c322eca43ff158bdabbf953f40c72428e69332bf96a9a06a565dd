I"ò<p>There has been a lot of activity the last couple weeks on the Liquibase extensions I manage and/or have source access to. There were a few running up against the Oct 15th jira-svn-shutdown deadline and also several that had not been updated to support Liquibase 3.0 yet.</p>

<p>For all of the extensions, I have moved their source repository out of the shared liquibase.jira.com subversion repository and into their own repositories at <a href="https://github.com/liquibase">https://github.com/liquibase</a>. They all now have their own issue tracking, wiki, and releases tab in their Github projects, which is the pattern I will be using for all the Liquibase-managed extensions.</p>

<p>I also released the new builds into Maven under the <a title="org.liquibase.ext" href="http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.liquibase.ext">org.liquibase.ext</a> group (some may still be propagating through the mirrors).</p>

<p>The main ‚ÄúLiquibase Extension Portal‚Äù is still at <a href="http://liquibase.org/extensions">liquibase.org/extensions</a>, the above extensions are simply the subset of extensions that I tend to manage. In the upcoming weeks, I will be working to improve the extension portal and the extension writing process in general (including better documentation)</p>
