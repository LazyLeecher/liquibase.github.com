I"<p>Part of the delay of the next 2.0 RC is that I want that release to include a 2.0 snapshot in the maven repository for people to try. Unfortunately, I have determined that my maven skills are not what I need them to be to make this happen, and am hoping I can get some help.</p>

<p>If you look at the liquibase source from <a href="http://liquibase.jira.com/source/browse/CORE">http://liquibase.jira.com/source/browse/CORE</a> you’ll see that we have what is probably an uncommon source configuration–which is the root of a lot of my maven issues.</p>

<p>The main source is broken up into three major sub-modules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>liquibase-core</li>
  <li>liquibase-core-jvm</li>
  <li>liquibase-maven-plugin</li>
</ul>

<p>each with its own pom.xml. The general idea is that the liquibase-core and liquibase-core-jvm modules are compiled and combined into a single jar file that is released as liquibase-core.jar while the liquibase-maven-plugin module is released independently. There is a liquibase-dist module that attempts to bind everything together in to liquibase-core, but I’m not sure if it is really doing it all correctly.</p>

<p>Prior to 2.0, liquibase was build using Ant and we do have a repository on sourceforge that is rsynced with the central maven repository. The old process used an ant task to update a local copy of that maven repository and I would upload the new/changed files to the sourceforge site manually.</p>

<p>The main questions that I know of currently are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How do I get maven to create the “liquibase-core “ module to release to the maven repository?</li>
  <li>What is the best way to create and release it? I would like the process to be based on builds from the <a href="http://liquibase.org/ci">build server</a>, not based on building the modules locally</li>
  <li>What improvements should I make to the module structure?</li>
  <li>Is what I am trying to do too much for maven’s preferred way of doing things?</li>
  <li>What should I be doing to help OSGi support?</li>
</ol>
