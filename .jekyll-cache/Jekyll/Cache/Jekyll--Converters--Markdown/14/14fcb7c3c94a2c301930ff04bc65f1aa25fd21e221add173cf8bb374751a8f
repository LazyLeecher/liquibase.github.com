I"Œ<p>One problem with running an open source project is that we donâ€™t really have â€œcustomersâ€ to contact for feedback and product suggestions. I can definitely just add features that* *I** think make sense, but one thing Iâ€™ve learned is that people use Liquibase in amazing ways I would never have imagined.</p>

<p>That is where the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/voxland.net/forms/d/1MUJl3wFKMFsDLdUJ1tQsaXQusudIj2tKiOKT50qW094/viewform">Liquibase survey</a> comes in: it is your chance to provide feedback on how you use Liquibase and what is important to you so that I can better prioritize efforts over the next year.</p>

<p>Your participation and time is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>If you know others that use Liquibase, please forward them the survey as well.</p>

<p>Even better, if you know someone who is NOT using Liquibase, send them the survey as well.</p>

<p>The more information I can gather the better picture I will have.</p>
