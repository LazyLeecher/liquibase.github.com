I"A<p>Liquibase 1.0 RC1 has been released. Changes since 0.9.1 are primarily code refactoring to make sure it is a clean code base to work with post-1.0. The only new feature is a batch and shell script for easier running of the command line migrator. There were also the usual documentation improvements and bug fixes.</p>
