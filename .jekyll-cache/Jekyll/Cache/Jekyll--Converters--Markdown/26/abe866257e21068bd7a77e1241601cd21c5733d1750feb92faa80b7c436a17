I"Ï<p>There was a null pointer issue that was tripping up enough people with 3.0.3 that I created a small 3.0.4 release to address the issue.</p>

<p>The issues fixed are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE-1423">CORE-1423</a> - NPE in ForeignKeyComparator</li>
  <li><a href="https://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE-548">CORE-548</a> - GenerateChangeLog generates invalid XML/SQL for mysql tables with autoincrement and compound PKs</li>
</ul>

<p>with CORE-1423 being the one most people were running into.</p>

<p>You can download 3.0.4 from <a href="http://liquibase.org/download">http://liquibase.org/download</a> and through the maven repository system once it gets mirrored through.</p>
