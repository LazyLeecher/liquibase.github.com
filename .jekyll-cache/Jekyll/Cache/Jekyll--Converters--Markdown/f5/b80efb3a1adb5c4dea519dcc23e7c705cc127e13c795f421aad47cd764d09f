I"<p>At long last, Liquibase 2.0 has been released.  For those of you watching closely, you know that 2.0.0 was actually released December 19th, but I wanted to give it a couple weeks (and a 2.0.1 release) before making the official announcement.  Liquibase 2.0 has been a long time coming, but I am very proud of it.  The most recent version (now 2.0.1) is available from the <a href="http://liquibase.org/download">download</a> page along with the <a href="http://liquibase.org/v2_upgrade">v2.0 upgrade guide</a>.</p>
