I"<p>I have made two Liquibase overview videos available to help explain what Liquibase is and some of its capabilities.  One is very brief (6 minutes) while the other is a more in-depth 30 minute video.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m planning on adding additional videos in the future.  If you have a suggestion on a topic you would like covered, <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/community.html">please let us know</a>.</p>

<p>The videos are available in the new <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/training.html">training section</a> of the website.</p>
