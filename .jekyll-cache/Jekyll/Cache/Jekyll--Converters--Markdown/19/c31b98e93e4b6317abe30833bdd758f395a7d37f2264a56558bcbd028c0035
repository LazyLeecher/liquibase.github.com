I" <p>I was never a huge fan of the upper case B in â€œLiquibaseâ€ but had gone along with it since that was how it was. However, Iâ€™ve decided now that it bugs me too much, and so I am officially changing the product name to â€œLiquibaseâ€ with a lower case B.</p>

<p>I changed some of the documentation and all uses in the code. If you find a documentation page with the old capitalization, please fix it up.</p>
