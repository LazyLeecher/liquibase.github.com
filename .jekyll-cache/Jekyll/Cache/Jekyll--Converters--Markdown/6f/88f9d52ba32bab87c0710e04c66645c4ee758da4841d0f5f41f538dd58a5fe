<p>Releases donâ€™t always go as planned, and Liquibase helps you ensure contingency plans are correct before each release. As you near a release, besides checking the updateSql output, you can also run <a href="documentation/rollback.html">futureRollbackSql</a> which will output the SQL needed to bring a fully updated database back to the current state.</p>

<h3 id="no-change-is-forgotten">No change is forgotten</h3>

<p>Liquibase <a href="documentation/databasechangelog.html">tracks which changelog statements</a> have run against each database, so you no longer have to manually track what statements have been run against each database and which have not.</p>

<h3 id="sanity-checks">Sanity checks</h3>

<p>Liquibase ships with several tools you can use to make sure changes are being applied correctly, check current database state, and that nobody is sneaking in changes out of process.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The status and validate commands report on what changeSets have not yet been ran and checks the changelog for errors.</li>
  <li>The <a href="/documentation/diff.html">diff</a> command reports on differences between databases to ensure that two fully updated databases are truly identical</li>
  <li>The <a href="/documentation/dbdoc.html">dbdoc</a> command generates documentation on the current database structure and its changes over time</li>
</ul>
