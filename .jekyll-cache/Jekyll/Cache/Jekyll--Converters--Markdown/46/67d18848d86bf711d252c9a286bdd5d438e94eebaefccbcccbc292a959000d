I"{<p>The Liquibase team is proud to announce the 1.6.0 Liquibase Core release.</p>

<p>This release focuses primarily on Hibernate integration which allows you to use the <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/manual/diff">diffChangeLog</a> functionality available with the command line and Ant to automatically generate Liquibase change sets based on new Hibernate mapping information.</p>

<p>This functionality is similar to what is offered with hbm2ddl, but with the added ability to control and modify the changes before they are applied. For more information, see <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/manual/hibernate">http://www.liquibase.org/manual/hibernate</a></p>

<p>Additional functionality includes a new “<a href="http://www.liquibase.org/manual/tag_database">tagDatabase</a>” tag, a “primaryKeyName” attribute on the column tag, as well as many bug fixes.</p>

<p>NOTE: Due to a bug in the change set md5 checksum generation in pre-1.6 releases, existing md5sum information needs to be cleared out of the databasechagelog table before running 1.6 for the first time. This can be done by running “<a href="http://www.liquibase.org/manual/command_line">liquibase clearCheckSums</a>” or by running “UPDATE DATABASECHANGELOG SET MD5SUM=NULL”</p>

<p>Upgrading is simply a matter of replacing the liquibase.jar file. To take advantage of newer change log features, change your XSD declaration to:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;databasechangelog xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/1.6"
    xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    schemalocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/1.6
    http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-1.6.xsd"&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Liquibase 1.6 can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/download">http://www.liquibase.org/download</a> and, as always, let us know if you have any questions or issues.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/manual/maven">Maven</a> and <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/manual/grails">Grails</a> plug-ins will be updated over the next week.</p>
