I"E<p>I know I was hoping that RC6 would be the last, but there were enough bugs/changes found that we need another RC buildâ€¦.</p>

<p>As usual, you can download the latest RC from <a href="http://liquibase.org/download">http://liquibase.org/download</a> and report issues to <a href="http://liquibase.org/forum">http://liquibase.org/forum</a>.</p>

<p>There was a change to how we compute checksums from RC6 to RC7, so it will be a good chance to test the checksum versioning code introduced in with 2.0, so let us know if you run into any changeSet checksum validation issues</p>
